    <h3>After this, we have a portion of the lyrics to "the Whole Being Dead Thing,"
        from Beetlejuice, The Musical</h3>

        <p>"There's no destiny or fate</p>
        <p>Just a terrifying wait</p> 
        <p>Full of people that you hate</p>
        <p>And on a certain date, the universe kills you!"</p>

        <p>"That's the thing with life
            No one makes it out alive!"</p>

    
    <h3>How's about you take a listen for yourself?</h3>
